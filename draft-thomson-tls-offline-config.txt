                draft-thomson-tls-offline-config-latest

Abstract

   Zero round trip operation in TLS relies on a client knowing about a
   server configuration prior to establishing a connection.  TLS
   provides a mechanism for a server to provide a configuration during a
   handshake so that subsequent connections can send encrypted data in
   its first flight of messages.  This document defines a format for
   this configuration information that can be used outside of TLS.

1.  Introduction

   A client that establishes a TLS connection to a server is unable to
   send any encrypted data to the server prior to receiving a server
   configuration.  This introduces a minimum of one round trip of
   latency to TLS connections.

   TLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] describes a zero round trip mode of
   operation that allows a client to send replayable data to a server.
   A server configuration is provided to clients in the handshake.  That
   configuration is used by the client to encrypt the first flight of
   messages it sends in subsequent connections.  While this first flight
   of messages can be replayed by an attacker, it has both
   confidentiality and integrity protection.  This enables use cases
   where the need to reduce latency is important, but replay protection
   is either not needed, or provided by other means.

   This document describes how a server configuration can be established
   outside of the TLS handshake.  This allows for alternative methods of
   delivery for the server configuration.

1.1.  Terminology

   RFC 2119 [RFC2119] defines the terms MUST, SHOULD, and MAY.

2.  Offline Server Configuration Format

   The offline server configuration is simply a ServerConfiguration,
   that is optionally signed.

   struct {
       ServerConfiguration config;
       select (authentication_required) {
           case true:
               digitally-signed struct {
                   ServerConfiguration config;
               };
           case false:
               struct {};
       }
   } OfflineServerConfiguration;

              Figure 1: OfflineServerConfiguration Definition

   Extensions to the ServerConfiguration object are used to convey the
   additional information needed for use outside of the TLS handshake
   are defined in Section 3.  An offline configuration MUST include the
   certificate and server_cipher_suites extensions.  An offline
   configuration that requests or permits client authentication MUST
   include the certificate_request extension.

2.1.  Offline Configuration Authentication

   A client MUST NOT use an offline server configuration unless it has
   been successfully authenticated, either by signature or other means.
   A signature is therefore necessary for all delivery mechanisms that
   do not provide a client with a means to ensure the authenticity and
   integrity of the configuration.

   The process for constructing and verifying digital signatures is
   defined in [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13].  The context string for the
   signature on an offline server configuration is "TLS 1.3, offline
   ServerConfiguration".  In this context, the signature and hash
   algorithm that are included MAY be any value that the server
   supports, provided that it is compatible with the key in the server's
   end-entity certificate or public key [RFC7250].

   If present, the signature MUST be validated against the public key in
   the included end-entity certificate.

   A client MUST NOT use an offline server configuration unless the end-
   entity certificate or public key is successfully validated according

   to the rules for the using protocol and application (such as
   [RFC2818] or [RFC6125]).

3.  Server Configuration Extensions

   The offline server configuration uses the same ServerConfiguration
   format that is defined in [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13], with extensions to
   carry the additional information that a client would ordinarily
   obtain from the TLS handshake.

   enum {
       server_cipher_suites(0), certificate(1),
       certificate_request(2), supported_groups(3),
       (65535)
   } ConfigurationExtensionType;

   struct {
       ConfigurationExtensionType extension_type;
       uint16 length;
       select (extension_type) {
           case server_cipher_suites:
               ServerCipherSuites;
           case certificate:
               Certificate;
           case certificate_request:
               CertificateRequest;
           case supported_groups:
               NamedGroupList;
       } extension_data;
   } ConfigurationExtension;


             Figure 2: ServerConfiguration Extension Additions

   Section 3 shows a modified version of the ConfigurationExtension
   structure from [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] that includes the extensions
   added in this document.  These extensions are defined in detail in
   subsequent sections.

3.1.  Server Cipher Suites

   A server configuration that appears in a TLS handshake is implicitly
   bound to the cipher suite that was negotiated in that handshake.
   Outside of a TLS handshake, a client need to be able to know which
   cipher suites are supported by the server.

   The "server_cipher_suites" extension to ServerConfiguration
   identifies the set of cipher suites that the server is willing to

   use.  This only applies to the replayable data that the client sends
   in its first flight; the remainder of the handshake is protected
   using a cipher suite that is negotiated in the usual fashion.

   CipherSuite ServerCipherSuites<2..2^16-2>;

               Figure 3: ServerCipherSuites Extension Format

   An offline server configuration MUST NOT be used if it does not
   include the "server_cipher_suites" extension.

   A client can choose any cipher suite from this set for protecting its
   first flight.  The client MUST include the selected value in the
   cipher_suites field of its ClientHello.  A server MAY reject either
   the replayable data or the entire handshake if the client selects a
   cipher suite that it does not claim to support.

   A server MAY choose to offer a smaller set of cipher suites for use
   in the client's first flight than it might support for a complete TLS
   handshake.  While the set of cipher suites advertised in a server
   configuration are not necessarily a strict subset of the cipher
   suites that a server is prepared to support for a handshake, this
   could.

   Clients MUST NOT alter the set of cipher suites they offer based on
   the value seen in a ServerConfiguration.  While a falsified
   ServerConfiguration might permit an attacker to decrypt replayable
   data, altering the set of cipher suites would also permit a cipher
   suite downgrade attack.

3.2.  Certificate

   The content of the "certificate" server configuration extension is
   identical to that of the Certificate handshake message in both syntax
   and semantics.  Note however that the ServerConfiguration extension
   limits the size of the certificate chain to 65535 octets.

3.3.  Certificate Request

   The content of the "certificate_request" server configuration
   extension is identical to that of the CertificateRequest message that
   a server sends to request that a client authenticate in both syntax
   and semantics.  This is included to allow the client to generate
   Certificate and CertificateVerify messages that the server is able to
   use.

   Including the "certificate_request" extension is only necessary when
   the server configuration permits client authentication.  That is,

Internet-Draft            TLS Offline Zero-RTT              October 2015


   when the "early_data_type" is set to either "client_authentication"
   or "client_authentication_and_data".

3.4.  Supported Groups

   The content of the "supported_groups" server configuration extension
   is identical to that of the "supported_groups" hello extension in
   both syntax and semantics.  The extension carries a NamedGroupList
   object as defined in [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13].  This is used by a client
   to select a client certificate for which the resulting signatures can
   be consumed by the server.

4.  Security Considerations

   Enabling zero round trip TLS in this fashion does not alter the
   limitations of sending data in the client's first flight of messages.
   In particular, the first flight of data from the client is not
   protected from replay.  Details of these limitations are provided in
   [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13].

   Server configurations that are generated offline MUST include a
   signature, unless integrity and authenticity is ensured by other
   mechanisms.  Failure to properly authenticate a server configuration
   would allow an attacker to substitute keying material, allowing data
   that was intended for a specific server to be encrypted toward any
   server.  Though the first flight from the client is not protected
   from replay, this would violate the integrity and confidentiality
   guarantees that are provided.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following ServerConfiguration extensions
   in the registry established by [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13]:

   o  server_cipher_suites Section 3.1

   o  certificate Section 3.2

   o  certificate_request Section 3.3

   o  supported_groups Section 3.4
